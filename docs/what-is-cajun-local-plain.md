# What Is Cajun Local? (Plain Language)

This page explains Cajun Local in everyday terms—what it is, who it’s for, and what people can do with it. No technical or developer jargon.

## What is Cajun Local?

**Cajun Local** is a members-only app that connects people in Acadiana (south Louisiana) with locally owned businesses. The idea is simple: help the community discover and support local restaurants, shops, and venues—and help those businesses reach customers.

Everything in the app is focused on **Louisiana**: businesses are tied to parishes (like Lafayette, St. Martin, Vermilion), and the content you see is all local.

## Who uses it?

- **Members** — People who download the app, create an account, and use it to find businesses, deals, and events.
- **Business owners and managers** — People who run a listed business (or have been approved to manage one). They can update their listing, add deals and events, and talk to customers through the app.
- **Admins** — A small team that keeps the app running: they approve new businesses and content, manage categories and settings, and help with payments and support.

## What can members do?

After signing in, members can:

- **Browse and search** — Look at local businesses by category (e.g. restaurants, music, shopping), by parish, or by name. Tap a business to see its details, hours, menu, deals, and events.
- **Save favorites** — Keep a short list of businesses they like. (How many they can save depends on their membership level.)
- **Use deals** — See current deals (e.g. percentage off, free item) and “claim” them when their membership allows. Some deals are for members only.
- **See events** — View events that local businesses are running (e.g. live music, tastings).
- **Get a random pick** — Use “Choose for me” to have the app suggest a random spot (e.g. a restaurant) when they can’t decide.
- **Ask Local** — (For paid members) Get AI-powered suggestions for where to go or what to try, based on what they’re in the mood for.
- **Message businesses** — Start or continue conversations with businesses from the app.
- **Get notified** — Receive in-app notifications about deals, events, or messages.
- **Manage their account** — Set which parishes they care about, view their profile, and sign out.

Members can also **request to add a new business** (e.g. their own). That request goes to admins for approval. **Only Cajun+ (or higher) members** can submit a new listing; others see an option to upgrade.

## What can business owners and managers do?

If someone is approved to manage a business (because they own it or were added as a manager):

- They can **edit the business listing** — Update the name, address, hours, menu, photos, links (e.g. website, social), and similar details.
- They can **add and manage deals** — Create promotions (e.g. 10% off, BOGO). How many deals and what types they can create depends on their business’s subscription tier.
- They can **add and manage events** — Post events that show up in the app’s events section.
- They can **run loyalty (punch) programs** — Set up punch cards (e.g. “buy 10, get 1 free”) and scan members’ cards when they visit.
- They can **see form submissions** — View and respond to messages or form submissions that customers send through the app.
- They can **use business ads** — (If set up) Promote their business in the app through paid ad placements.

New businesses don’t go live until an **admin approves** them. The same goes for deals, reviews, and some other content—admins make sure everything meets the app’s standards.

## What do admins do?

Admins use a separate **admin dashboard** inside the app (available from the menu when you have an admin account). From there they:

- **Approve or reject content** — New businesses, claims (“I own this business”), reviews, deals, and images. Nothing goes live without going through this process when required.
- **Manage the directory** — Add or edit categories and subcategories (e.g. “Restaurants,” “Cajun”), and manage the list of parishes. They can also add businesses directly (e.g. unclaimed listings).
- **Manage content** — Add or edit blog posts and category banners that members see on the home and explore screens.
- **Handle support and payments** — View form submissions from the public, see payment history, manage user roles (e.g. who is an admin), and send in-app notifications. They can also manage subscription plans and ad packages.
- **Keep records** — Use the audit log to see what changed and who did it, for support and safety.

Admins don’t need to know how the app is built; the dashboard is designed so they can do all of this through screens and forms.

## How does membership work?

The app has **membership levels** that determine what a member can do:

- **Free** — Can browse, search, and save a **limited number** of favorites. Cannot claim deals, add a business, or use Ask Local. Good for trying the app.
- **Cajun+ (paid)** — More favorites, can claim deals, can **request/add a new business** (for admin approval), and can use **Ask Local**. This is the main upsell for people who want to support local and get more out of the app.
- **Pro (or higher)** — Even more (or unlimited) features, including everything in Cajun+ and often more deals and visibility for businesses they manage.

If someone tries to do something that requires a paid membership (e.g. add a listing or use Ask Local), the app will explain that and offer an upgrade. On the “My Listings” screen, users who are not Cajun+ see messaging that encourages them to upgrade so they can add or request a listing.

## How do the pieces fit together?

- **Signing in** — When you sign in, the app knows who you are and what membership you have. It then shows or hides options (e.g. “Add listing,” “Ask Local”) based on that.
- **Business listings** — Businesses are either approved (visible to everyone), pending (waiting on admin), or rejected. Only approved businesses show up in search and explore. Categories and parishes help members filter. Business owners and managers see their own listing in “My Listings” and can edit it; admins can edit any listing and approve or reject it.
- **Deals and events** — Same idea: they’re created by managers, and often need admin approval before they go live. Members see approved deals and events and can claim or RSVP when their membership allows.
- **Admin** — Only accounts that have been given the “admin” role can open the admin dashboard. That dashboard is the control center for approvals, categories, parishes, payments, and support—all in one place.

## Summary

**Cajun Local** is a local-first app for Acadiana: members discover and support local businesses; businesses get a listing, deals, and events; and admins keep the directory and content in good shape. Membership levels (free vs Cajun+ vs Pro) control what members can do, and the admin dashboard keeps everything running without needing technical knowledge.
